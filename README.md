Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an audio engineer, an IT enthusiast, a former psychology student at Federico II, and currently a student at the Apple Academy. I've always had a deep interest in the world of IT, particularly in the areas of machine learning and AI.

When I'm not deciphering the complexities of the human mind or tuning sound frequencies, you'll likely find me immersed in tech. I use a variety of resources for learning, ranging from professional courses such as Google's IT Specialist program, to hands-on practice developing websites using Java and CSS.

## ⚙️ My Skills

- 🔊 A strong background in Psychology and Audio Engineering (an intriguing combination, isn't it?)
- 💻 Web development with Java and CSS
- 🤝 Experience in IT Support, honing a variety of soft skills (talk about being under pressure!)
- 🍎 iOS development and Swift (courtesy of the Apple Developer Academy)

## 📚 What I'm Learning

As part of my never-ending journey of learning, I'm currently expanding my understanding of Swift, and branching out into Java, Python, and C++. Can someone say "lifelong learner"?

## 🫠 Fun Facts

In my free time, I love making rap beats 🥁 . I tell you more, I literally can't start my day without some loud, hard music to wake me up! 🔊

And if you're wondering how psychology, music and coding connect, don't worry. I'm still exploring that fascinating intersection too. 😉
